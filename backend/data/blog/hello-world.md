## Hello world

Hello! This is my Hello World Blog. I’m Anuj Naresh Chetwani, a DevOps engineer and software developer.
I work on building and managing cloud infrastructure, automating processes, and creating software solutions that make life easier.
This blog is my space to share my experiences, lessons learned, experiments, and projects in DevOps, software development, and technology in general.
While this is the first post, I’ll be adding more blogs, tutorials, and insights over time.

## Python Fun

Here's some dummy Python code for fun:

```python
# Hello World in Python with a little DevOps flair

def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World! 👋")
    print("Welcome to my DevOps + SDE journey 🚀")

# Simulate a small CI/CD pipeline step
def deploy():
    print("Building Docker image...")
    print("Running tests...")
    print("Deploying to AWS...")
    print("Deployment successful! ✅")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
    deploy()
```
